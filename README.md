# Tactile-Project
Sensitive, low-cost 1-axis tactile sensors with a small footprint.

Final version uses a Hall-effect sensor (Si7211) with a cylindrical 2.0 (D) x 0.5 mm N42 magnet embedded in the silicone cap developed for a sensing range of 0.0059 - 11.3 N. The sensor measures 6.8 mm in height, and 7.4 mm in diameter.
